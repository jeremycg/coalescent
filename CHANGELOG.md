# Changelog

## 2.0.0

Initial release of **Coalescent** — the merge of four previously separate plugins
into one. The modules (GENDYN, Haptik, Axon, Soma) are unchanged in behaviour;
this release is the unification:

- Single plugin slug/brand `Coalescent`, one manifest, one Makefile.
- Four modules under one brand: **GENDYN**, **Haptik**, and the **Neuron** pair
  **Axon** (FitzHugh–Nagumo) and **Soma** (Hindmarsh–Rose), grouped by a shared
  name prefix, accent/panel language, and the `Synth Voice` tag.
- Axon and Soma share an RK4 integrator under `src/neuron/`.
- Demo patches regenerated against the `Coalescent` plugin slug.
- Per-module documentation under `docs/`; new top-level README.

Module behaviour carried forward from the prior standalone plugins:

- **Axon / Soma** — polyphony (up to 16 voices), hard SYNC input, and a right-click
  anti-aliasing (oversampling) option.
- **GENDYN** — Xenakis GENDY3 dynamic stochastic synthesis with pitch LOCK.
- **Haptik** — scanned synthesis with Fast/Slow lattice modes and FREEZE.
